Project Odyssey â€“ Interview Assessment (Project Emory)
This project was completed as part of my interview process for Project Emory. The task was to implement and refine an early iteration of a Next.js todo application, filling in all required features.

What was completed:

Implemented proper React key props and fixed styling so todos render in a vertical list

Designed and styled todo items with TailwindCSS, including checkbox indicators and completion states

Added state management for todos with the ability to add new tasks from user input

Implemented functionality to mark tasks as complete and delete them from the list

Integrated a database using Prisma and Next.js server actions, so tasks persist after page refreshes

Added a refresh mechanism to synchronize frontend state with the database

This project was fun to work on, especially the database portion. While it was challenging since Prisma and server actions were new to me, I really enjoyed learning and building out full persistence for the app!
